# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
This project implements a Multimodal Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system that identifies human emotions by analyzing both speech signals (audio features) and spoken content (text).
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- XGBoost (for speech emotion recognition)
- Logistic Regression (for text emotion recognition)
- GoEmotions dataset (for text-based emotion recognition)
- RAVDESS dataset (for speech-based emotion recognition)


## Features
- **Real-time Speech Emotion Recognition**: Converts speech to text and recognizes emotion from both speech and text.
- **Multi-Modal Emotion Recognition**: Combines results from both speech and text models for more accurate emotion detection.
- **Web Interface**: The system uses Streamlit for an interactive user interface.
